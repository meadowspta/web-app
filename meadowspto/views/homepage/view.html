        <p class="text-center">
          The mission of the Meadows PTO is to positively impact the lives of all children and families by representing our members and empowering and supporting them with skills in advocacy, leadership, and communication.  Our main goal for our active community is to obtain 100% participation from our Meadows Families. We invite all parents to join us in supporting your children and their teachers in one of the various ways possible:

                By asking $100 per child, we hope to reach our goal for our Meadows PTO fund. Your donation is what makes your child’s year possible. This includes field trips, technology (SmartBoards, cameras, ink, software, etc), book fairs, assemblies, classroom supplies, and many more programs that benefit your child(ren)’s education.

                Please consider being actively involved in your child’s education by helping at school events, including, but not limited to activities that occur during regular school hours. Your help is what keeps our school going! By seeing you invest your time in their school, your children benefit with increased motivation in their work, which raises their self-esteem and pride, therefore improving their educational experience and growth.

                These meetings are your chance for your voice to be heard. Decisions on how your membership and donations are spent are presented and voted on at these meetings, so your attendance is highly suggested and encouraged! We want to get to know you!

                By going paperless and using electronic mail, we hope to save $4,000-$6,000 of your donations which would be better spent in their classrooms and for activities for your children. On the membership form, if no e-mail is provided then your child will bring home paper newsletters and notices from the PTO.

          Help keep Meadows strong! Make your donation today!
        </p>
        <p>
          All donations directly benefit the children of Meadows School. Your funds help in the purchase of technology equipment, school supplies, provide field trips and assemblies to the classrooms. Without your support, our children wouldn't be able to go on multiple field trips throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you know:
          <ul>
            <li>scheduling a bus for 2 classes costs about $1,000 for five hours</li>
            <li>school supplies are not just having paper for copiers but also maintenance on the machines and the purchase of toner and ink</li>
            <li>assemblies usually begin at $300 per presentation and go up from there</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          All these things supplement the education and experience your children receive at Meadows. We understand that $90 per child is a significant sacrifice in this tough economy. But by becoming a member of the Meadows PTO for less than $.75/day per child, you help the continued excellence at Meadows School for not only our children but for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need your help to reach our goal of $20,000 to achieve all this! Whatever you can give is greatly appreciated and your donation is 100% tax-deductible, our Tax ID is 94-6183993. Please make checks payable to Meadows PTO.

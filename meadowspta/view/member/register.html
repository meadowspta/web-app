    New this year your basic PTA Membership is FREE (a $10 value) - In addition, for each parent that joins, $4.50 of that membership is paid the National PTA and State PTA dues for educational advocacy for our children, so please consider making a donation to cover the expenses needed to fully support and supplement your childâ€™s education with the tools, events and programs that Meadows PTA wants to provide.
